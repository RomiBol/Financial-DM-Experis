## Financial-DM-Experis - BI Project

This project aims to develop a BI solution for Experis Academy as part of the BI systems Development training. The primary focus is on creating a financial Data Mart for Experis, which will be used to develop comprehensive reports in Power BI.

###Project Overview
1. Project Specifications – Plan the Data Mart based on a set list of requirements, create an Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD), Compose a specification document, and prepare a project Gantt chart.
2. Power BI Reports – transform and visualize the data in Power BI. This phase involves finalizing the ERD model by setting correct cardinalities and relationships, adding calculated columns, calculating measures using DAX, and creating visualizations for the reports (Customer Billing Report, Employee Payroll Report, Employee Overview Report, and an Executive Dashboard).

###Repository Contents
